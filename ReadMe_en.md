#### ⚠️ Notes

1. **CORS**: Ensure the API supports CORS and allows access from the GitHub Pages domain
2. **HTTPS**: GitHub Pages uses HTTPS; the API must also be HTTPS
3. **Proxy Server**: If the API does not support CORS, you can use a proxy server (such as the `cros.xiongdaa.me` in bio.html)
4. **Error Handling**: The page will display an error message if the API fails; please ensure the API is stable and available

**Recommended Usage:**
- Self-host JSON files on GitHub/Gitee
- Use third-party JSON storage services (such as JSONBin, LowDB)
- Solve cross-domain issues via a proxy server

### Edit Music API

Music search API configuration is in the `<script>` section of `index.html`:

```javascript
// QQ Music API
const url = `https://cyapi.top/API/qq_music.php?apikey=${CYAPI_KEY}...`;

// NetEase Cloud Music API
const url = `https://v2.alapi.cn/api/music/search?keyword=...`;
```

Please replace with a usable API key.

### 🆕 Custom Background (Image/Video)

The page supports setting custom backgrounds. You can upload local image or video files in the settings panel:

- **Image Background**: Supports JPG/PNG/WebP and other common image formats
- **Video Background**: Supports MP4/WebM and other video formats; automatically loops playback
- **Persistent Save**: Background settings are automatically saved to browser localStorage and automatically restored after page refresh

### 🆕 Bing Wallpaper

The page has integrated Bing Daily Wallpaper. Click the wallpaper switch button to get the latest Bing HD wallpaper:

- Uses `bing.biturl.top` API to get full-size original images (not cached thumbnails)
- Automatically adapts to desktop/mobile resolution
- Wallpaper preference (whether to enable Bing wallpaper) is persistently saved

### 🆕 History

Music playback history is automatically recorded:

- Every time a song is played, it is automatically added to the history list
- History is saved in localStorage and is not lost after closing the page
- Can be quickly reviewed and replayed in the player panel

### 🆕 Default Wallpaper API Updated

The default wallpaper source has been updated to a more stable interface:

- New default wallpaper API: `https://img.8845.top/acg`
- Less request delay, higher success rate
- To change the wallpaper source, modify the `DEFAULT_BG_API` configuration in the `<script>` section of `index.html`
